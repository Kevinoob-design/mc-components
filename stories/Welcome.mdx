<h1>Welcome to Our AngularJS Proof of Concept Repo!</h1>
<p>Hey There!</p>
<p>
	Welcome to our little corner of the internet! We're excited to share with you a proof of concept that showcases
	what's still possible with AngularJS, even though it's officially deprecated.
</p>
<h2>The Truth About AngularJS</h2>
<p>
	We know, we know - AngularJS is no longer the shiny new thing. But the truth is, many large-scale projects are still
	using it, and migrating to newer frameworks isn't always feasible. So, we're exploring what's still possible with
	AngularJS.
</p>
<h2>What Can You Expect?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		A collection of code snippets, examples, and experiments that push the boundaries of what's possible with
		AngularJS
	</li>
	<li>Some documentation on how we overcame common challenges and limitations</li>
	<li>A chance to provide feedback, suggestions, and ideas to help us improve</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Bother with AngularJS?</h2>
<p>
	We believe that just because something is deprecated, it doesn't mean it's useless. Many projects still rely on
	AngularJS, and with the right approach, it's still possible to build amazing things. We're on a mission to prove
	that with creativity, determination, and a bit of hacking, you can still achieve great things with AngularJS.
</p>
<h2>Our Approach: Micro Components</h2>
<p>
	We're building a micro component library based on the micro frontend architecture. This approach allows us to break
	down complex applications into smaller, reusable pieces, making it easier to maintain, update, and extend our
	codebase. By focusing on small, independent components, we can create a more modular and scalable architecture
	that's better suited for large-scale applications.
</p>
<h3>What is a Micro Component?</h3>
<p>
	A micro component is a small, self-contained piece of code that performs a specific function. It's a tiny, reusable
	building block that can be easily composed with other micro components to create more complex applications. By using
	micro components, we can create a more modular and flexible architecture that's easier to work with.
