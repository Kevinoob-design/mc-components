# General improvements and should's that this project will have

- [ ] Improve naming convention of component (document how it should be done)
- [ ] Improve package versioning and deployment to Artifactory (maybe use SHA?)
- [ ] Improve testing, add PlayRight to the mix (check that the base testing does cover well all that has to do)
- [ ] Improve IAC to be more env specific and avoid repetitions (you prob don't need more the one s3 for remote state)
- [ ] Improve templating: add stories to the creation of components
- [ ] Improve development experience (npmrc is an annoyance when there is no token)
- [ ] Standardize how components are created, when should we expand a component? when should we create a new one?
- [ ] Add S3 deployment on IAC for SPA StoryBook app
- [x] Add StoryBook to the mix
- [x] Upgrade Nodejs version
- [ ] Improve overall documentation (add mr-check list, detailed all in the primary document but separate section into links if necessary)
- [x] Improve pipeline (sure there is a lot to do there)
- [x] Add tailwind to the mix (better css config and reusable classes)
